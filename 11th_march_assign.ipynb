    "### T-Test:\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-test accounts for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.\n",

    "An electronics company mobiles with a mean weight of 1 pounds and a\n",
    "standard deviation of 0.1 pounds. A random sample of 25 mobiles is taken, and the sample mean weight\n",
    "is found to be 0.9 pounds. Test the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 1\n",
    "pounds with a significance level of 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Test:\n",
    "A z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, allowing the sample mean to be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:-\n",
    "average weight of student is found to be 153cm in a school. with satandard deviation of 10 cm. we take sample of 100 students and found average to be 156 with standard deviation of 9 cm. Is the average height assumption for whole school is true ?"

    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test, is a type of hypothesis test that focuses on only one direction of the distribution of data. In other words, it tests whether a sample statistic is significantly greater than or significantly less than a hypothesized population parameter. A one-tailed test is used when you have a specific expectation about the direction of the effect you're investigating.\n",

It tests whether a sample statistic is significantly different from a hypothesized population parameter, without specifying whether it's greater or less than that parameter. A two-tailed test is used when you want to determine if there is any significant difference between the sample and population parameters, regardless of the direction.\n",
