    "### Wrapper Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: The Wrapper method evaluates different subsets of features by actually training a model on them. It uses the performance of the model (e.g., accuracy, AUC, etc.) as the evaluation criterion for selecting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporates the Learning Algorithm: It involves repeatedly training and evaluating the model with different subsets of features. This means that the performance of the learning algorithm is directly taken into account during the feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally Expensive: Since it involves training a model for every subset of features, it can be computationally expensive, especially with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Techniques: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Exhaustive Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consideration of Feature Interactions: It can take into account interactions between features, which is a limitation of the Filter method.\n",

    "Approach: The Filter method evaluates the relevance of features based on statistical properties like correlation, mutual information, etc. It does not involve training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does Not Incorporate the Learning Algorithm: It doesn't take the learning algorithm into account during feature selection. It operates on the dataset independently of the actual learning algorithm.\n",

    "Computationally Efficient: It is computationally less expensive compared to the Wrapper method because it doesn't involve building models.\n",

    "Embedded feature selection methods are techniques that perform feature selection as part of the model training process. These methods automatically select the most relevant features while the model is being trained. Here are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 - LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term (L1 regularization) to the linear regression loss function. This penalty encourages the model to select a sparse set of features by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero.\n",
    "It effectively performs feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to LASSO, Ridge Regression adds a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the linear regression loss function. While it doesn't lead to exact feature selection (i.e., it doesn't set coefficients to zero), it can still downweight less important features.\n",
    "It can be more stable than LASSO when there are highly correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3- Elastic Net:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net combines both L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) penalties in the linear regression loss function. This allows it to benefit from both the feature selection capability of LASSO and the stability of Ridge.\n",
    "It provides a balance between LASSO and Ridge, potentially offering better performance in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4- Decision Trees with Pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees can be used for feature selection by examining which features are used to make decisions near the top of the tree. Pruning techniques can be applied to simplify the tree and retain only the most important features.\n",
    "It provides an intuitive way to understand feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are ensemble learning methods that inherently provide feature importance scores. They evaluate the contribution of each feature in making accurate predictions across multiple trees.\n",
    "They can be used for both classification and regression tasks and offer robust feature importance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6- L1-based feature selection for Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs can be combined with L1 regularization to perform feature selection. This encourages the SVM to focus on a smaller subset of features.\n",
    "It can be particularly effective when there are many irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7- Neural Networks with L1 or L2 Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, adding L1 or L2 regularization terms to the loss function can encourage the network to learn a sparse set of features.\n",
    "It allows neural networks to perform implicit feature selection during training."

    "3-Not Adaptive to Model Selection: The features selected by the Filter method are chosen before any specific model is considered, which means they may not be the most relevant for the final chosen model.\n",

    "4-Sensitive to Data Distribution: Some metrics used in the Filter method (like correlation) assume linear relationships, which may not capture more complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "6-Less Effective for Complex Tasks: In tasks where the relationship between features and the target variable is intricate or nonlinear, the Filter method may not perform as well.\n",
