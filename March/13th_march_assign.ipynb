    "### Assumptions in ANOVA,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independence of Observations:\n",
    "The observations within and between groups should be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not be related to the value of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Violation: If you have a repeated measures design where the same subjects are used in multiple groups, and there is a carryover effect from one group to another, this violates the independence assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homogeneity of Variance:\n",
    "The variances of the groups being compared should be roughly equal. In other words, the spread of data within each group should be approximately the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Violation: If you are comparing the test scores of students from three different schools, and the variance of scores in one school is much larger than in the others, this violates the homogeneity of variance assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normality:\n",
    "The residuals (the differences between observed values and predicted values) for each group should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is particularly important for smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Violation: If you have a small sample size and the residuals in one group are not normally distributed, this could impact the validity of ANOVA results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independence of Groups:\n",
    "The groups you are comparing should be independent of each other. This means that individuals in one group should not be related to individuals in another group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Violation: If you are comparing the salaries of employees in different departments of a company, and some employees are in multiple departments simultaneously, this violates the independence of groups assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Sampling:\n",
    "The data should be obtained through random sampling or a well-controlled experimental design. This ensures that the results are generalizable to the broader population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Violation: If you only collect data from a convenience sample of individuals who are readily available, this may not represent the broader population.\n"

    "### One-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "One-Way ANOVA is used when you have one independent variable with more than two levels or groups, and you want to determine if there are any statistically significant differences among the means of these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you have three different teaching methods (Group A, Group B, and Group C) and you want to determine if there's a significant difference in student test scores among these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Way ANOVA:\n",
    "Two-Way ANOVA is used when you have two independent variables and you want to examine their combined effects on a dependent variable. It helps you determine if there are interactions between the two factors and if each factor individually has a significant effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You're studying the effect of both a new drug treatment and gender on patient recovery time. Two-Way ANOVA allows you to analyze whether the drug, gender, or their interaction significantly affects recovery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeated Measures ANOVA:\n",
    "Repeated Measures ANOVA is used when you have a single group of participants, and each participant is measured under multiple conditions or at multiple time points. It helps assess whether there are significant differences across the repeated measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You're studying the impact of a training program on individuals' performance, and you measure their performance before training, immediately after training, and one month after training. Repeated Measures ANOVA helps determine if there's a significant change over time."
